# back-end-eCommerce

## Description

This repository contains the back-end functionality of an eCommerce platform. It is built with Javascript, is executed with Node.js and utilizes npm packages Express, MySQL, and Sequelize. When initialized this application allows the user to create, delete, update, and get from the ecommerce database categories, products, and tags. 

The most challenging aspect of this project was establishing the model relationships. however, I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Sequelize and how it simplifies command-line interations with the database. I look forward to gaining more experience with working with these packages. 

## Installation
Install the necessary npm packages for this app by running `npm install` in your terminal.

## Credits
When creating this repository I utilized the Sequelize documentation to ensure I was using proper syntax and to help address any bugs/problems I came across. One specific error I ran into that the Sequelize documentation helped me solve was "SequelizeEagerLoadingError". I received this error message when testing one of the routes and the documentation helped me conclude that the error was that two of my models were not properly associated.
